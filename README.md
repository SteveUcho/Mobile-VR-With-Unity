# Mobile-VR-With-Unity
This is a VR mobile experice of the Never Built New York (NBNY) exhibit that took place in the Queens Museum
## Note:
This was made in an older version of Unity, Uknown, and was building fine. I tested it using the latest as of today, July 30 2018 11:33 PM.
## How it was made
* Unity for game engine
* Never Built New York Pamflets and site for model reference
* Maya 3D for model creation
* Topographic data from online source, forgot... sorry
* Google VR and Cardboard for VR experience
## How to run
It should run on unity by just cloning repo but may not build properly, unkown cause. Last I tried, July 29, I ran into unity build issues due to incompatibility of previous unity. Xcode also is a pain...
